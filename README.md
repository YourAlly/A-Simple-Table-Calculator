# OS Scheduling Calculator

I didn't have to do this, but here I am

I need a way to answer these questions without having to calculate and draw a gantt chart for every item.

Thought of using Tkinter at first, but it looks like using JavaScript is better since it looks like JavaScript is really important nowadays.

# Languages I will use:
		
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Python (Maybe if we want to make the server handle the calculations)


# How the final product should look like:
	
I have no idea, but most likely i’ll just use a single page and just use XML http requests to retrieve data from the server if I use python (I did).

# Was it worth it?:
	
I’m not yet done, but I’m sure it’s a no. It’s fun though.
